# Matrix

*Matrix* is a linear algebra library for manipulating dense matrices. Its
primary design goal is ease of use.  It is desirable that the *Matrix* package
interact with standard Elixir language constructs and other packages.  The
underlying storage mechanism is, therefore, Elixir lists.

A secondary design consideration is for the module to be reasonably efficient
in terms of both memory usage and computations.  Unfortunately there is a
trade off between memory efficiency and computational efficiency.  Where these
requirements conflict *Matrix* will use the more computationally efficient
algorithm.

Each matrix is represented as a "list of lists" whereby a 3x4 matrix is
represented by a list of three items, with each item a list of 4 values.
Constructors are provided for several common matrix configurations including
zero filled, one filled, random filled the identity matrix, etc.

## Installation

Add *matrix* as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
def deps do
  [ { :matrix, "~> 0.3.0" } ]
end
```

After you are done, run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch and compile
Matrix. Start an interactive Elixir shell with `iex -S mix` and try the examples
in the [examples section](#examples).


## Documentation

Documentation for the package is available online via Hex at
[http://hexdocs.pm/matrix](http://hexdocs.pm/matrix).  You can also generate
local docs via the mix task
```elixir
mix docs
```
This will generate the HTML documentation and place it into the `doc` subdirectory.

## Examples
```elixir
iex> Matrix.new(3, 4)
[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

iex> Matrix.ident(4)
[[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]
```
